# contentful-serve-content-API
In this repo I write about Contentful.com a very useful service where users can serve content to any device.

In this modern world about web development, almost all web companies are providing API's to theirs users and the main reason for that is to provide/serve content to almost any device; Desktop, Mobile, Tablets, VR and much more to comes. So I read a Medium Blog post about [Hos to use API first platforms to build your website faster](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-use-api-first-platforms-to-build-your-websites-faster-e917e8318ee) and the author use a great and new tool for me called [Contentful.com](https://www.contentful.com/) as they say in their site you can just "Ship your digital products faster
Remove content bottlenecks and enable developers and content creators to do their best work, together."

## Create Models
With Contentful, you can create Models in order to store your data, for example you can create **Experts** and **Technology** Models and also you can define **Fields** from 1 - 50 fields and the fields can be: Text, Number, Date and Time, Location, Media, Boolean, JSON Object, Reference
